# üìä Mortgage Trading Analysis in Power BI

## üîç Project Overview

This Power BI report analyzes the trading performance and risk profile of a mortgage loan portfolio. It brings together multiple datasets to support decision-making in secondary mortgage markets, highlighting loan statuses, bid activity, bond pricing, and borrower credit data.

The goal is to enable institutions or analysts to:
- Evaluate loan sale readiness
- Compare bids across institutions
- Monitor loan status through processing stages
- Benchmark loans against UMBS bond prices
- Assess borrower and property risk indicators

## üìÅ Data Model

The report integrates five datasets with relationships based on `loan_id`:

### 1. **Loan Balances**
- Loan payment progress, interest rates, balances

### 2. **Loan Status**
- Key dates in the mortgage file lifecycle (audit, custodian, etc.)

### 3. **Loan Bids**
- Competitive bid values from multiple institutions

### 4. **UMBS Prices**
- Bond data to evaluate mortgage-backed securities pricing

### 5. **Loan Data**
- Full mortgage metadata: credit score, LTV, DTI, location, occupancy, loan type, etc.
